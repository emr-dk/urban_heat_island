# Urban Heat Island Effect

## Introduction
Urban Heat Island Effect (or UHI) is a phenomenon where the temperature in urban areas is higher than the surrounding rural areas. This is caused by the urban areas having a higher heat capacity than the surrounding rural areas. In cities this is manifested as different areas of the city having higher temperatures than other areas.

## Theory
The UHI can be defined as the difference in temperature between areas in a city. This can be expressed as:

This can be calculated by using satellite imagery and sensor data. The satellite imagery can be used to determine the surface temperature of the city. The sensor data can be used to determine the temperature of the air. The difference between these two values is the UHI.

## Data and methods
Using sentinel 2 satellite imagery, the surface temperature of the city can be determined. This is done by using the band 10 of the satellite imagery. This band is in the thermal infrared spectrum, which means that it can be used to determine the surface temperature of the city. The sensor data can be used to determine the temperature of the air. This is done by using the temperature sensor data from the weather stations in the city. The difference between these two values is the UHI.
