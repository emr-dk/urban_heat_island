# Urban Heat Island Effect

## Introduction
Urban Heat Island Effect (or UHI) is a phenomenon where the temperature in heavily built up urban areas is higher than the surrounding less built-up areas. The reason for this is the higher heat capacity of these impervious surfaces.

## Theory
The UHI can be defined as the difference in temperature between areas in a city. This can be expressed as:

This can be calculated by using satellite imagery and sensor data. The satellite imagery can be used to determine the surface temperature of the city. The sensor data can be used to determine the temperature of the air. The difference between these two values is the UHI.
